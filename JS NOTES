Chrome Console - allows you to run your JS in the dev tools - this is where it prints out
Comments - same as CSS
; - use at the end of each expression block
CAPS matters! var myName is not the same as var myName
Getting an Error? - Google that error, Stack Overflow is helpful

Ensure your Script tag is at the bottom of your HTML page like ex below
      <script src="main.JS" charset="utf-8"></script>

      </body>
      </html>

variables - like a bucket, object you create to store a value
    var - give it any name you would like
      Use camel case - myName instead of my-name like in CSS
      Start with letters, $ or underscore _
      Can't start with any other symbols or numbers

    1)String - Anything inside "" are called a string - you can use double or single quotes, recommend double
          var myName = "Brandon";

    2)Number - one of the 5 primitive types

    3)boolean - will either be true or false
        var yourName = true;
        true = 1
        false = 0

    4)undefined - undefined variable in the code

    5)null - means nothing, wont' get an error, but means nothing is there don't use this

Operators - adds more functionality

    Key operators are +, -, *, /
    console.log(5+5); - will print out 10
    console.log('5+5'); - will print out 5+5
    console.log('andi ' + 'coaker') - note spaces need to be inside the quotes to print
    (9 + '9') - prints out as 99 - concatenation
    PEMDAS - order of operators
    ! - means not
        !true - means False
        !false - means True

    Coersion - JS tries to quess/change one of your values based on what it might be expecting.
          1 + '1' - will print 11, turning it into string
    Bonus Operators - false wil coerce into 0, 0 can be coerced into false. True will coerce into 1, 1 (or any value oher than 0) can coerce into true.


Conditionals

    8 === 8 - use to identify if something is exactly the same, strictly equals - renders false
    8 === '8' - loosely equals - will render True

    Examples
        if(4 + 4 === 3) {
          console.log ('This Was True')
        } else {
          console.log ('This Was False')
        }

        Else IF
        if(4 + 4 === 10) {
          console.log ('This Was True')
        } else if (2 +2 === 4){
          console.log ('This is Also True')
        } else {
          console.log ('This is False');
        }

        Nesting - you can have multiple if statements within the conditional
