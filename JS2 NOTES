Functions
  first define function
  second call/invoke function
  third console.log to view in the console
  you can console.log an actual function
      console.log(numPlusNum(6,8));

        function orange (spaghetti, macaroni) {
          return spaghetti + macaroni;
        }

        function orange (spaghetti, macaroni) {
          return spaghetti + macaroni;
          var sum;
            sum = spaghetti + macaroni;
        return sum;
        }

        console.log(orange(5, 10)):

  scope -
    declaring a variable inside of a function will console an Error
    declaring a variable outside of function will allow the variable to be used in function


Objects
  groups information and is centered around one specific item
  made up of key value pairs
  values can be most anything
  should ONLY be made up of the property and it's value
  use curly brackets
    inside the curly brackets, you don't use the object-dot-property syntax. Instead, you use "property-colon-value-comma" syntax.
  use square brackets if you want to use a string .["string"] 
    This allows for dynamic property look-up
  use the equal sign = to define outside of brackets
  you can overwrite values within an object

    var tree + {
    type: "dogwood"
    }
    tree.height = 5
    tree.["age"] = "10 years"


  you can call an array off of an object


Arrays
    basically giant lists
    start at 0, not at 1
    uses square brackets []
    separate items by commas
    var myArray = [joe, bob, dave];
    can use .Commands on Arrays
      myArray.join("") = will join all objects together
      .push - takes value and adds to end of an array
      .length - shows the number of items in an array


    arrays & objects can nest inside each other to contain data in one place

Window - everything in the entire browser

iife - immediately invoked function
  Use -  }());
  use it to protect your code - wrap everything inside of an iife
  it allows the code to stay just within a specific function, instead of overwriting the code outside of the function
  as soon as we run this code and it hits a function, it will define it and run it at the same time
