Questions

    1) Define the term operator and explain what their purpose is in JavaScript.
        Help add more functionality. Our basic math functions - +, -, *, /.

    2) Please list the five primitives types in JavaScript.
        number, string, boolean, undefined, null

    3) Take a look at the table below and identify the primitive types next to each one.

          What Primitive Type is this?	Answer
          45	- Number
          "I heart JS"	- String
          'Pizza is life'	- String
          3.14	- number
          true	- boolean
          " "	- string
          false	- boolean
          '5,5555' - string

    4) Write a short sentence explaining how expressions work and why they are useful in JavaScript.
        Expressions help to evaluate our code when we check the console.  Example would be the conditional If...Else.

/*=========================================================
      Part 1: Variables
  */
  var givenName;
  // Q: What value is stored in `givenName` right now?
  // A: undefined


  givenName = "Brett";
  // Q: What is `givenName` set to now?
  // A: Brett


  givenName = givenName;
  // Q: What is `givenName` set to now?
  // A: Brett

Exercise 2

  Using the above code, create a variable called greeting that will store the expression below with givenName being used. You should use console.log to help test your code.

  The final output should look like: Hello, how are you Brett?

Exercise 5

  Take the following two variables:

  var myAge = 45;
  
  Write a conditional statement that will test if an age is over 100. If it is set a variable isOld to true otherwise set it to false.

Exercise 6

  Each of the following blocks of JavaScript contains errors. Take a look at each and do the following:

  Identify which line the error occurs on.
  Explain the cause of the error
  Fix the error, so the code produces the desired response.

  var firstName = "Julia";
  var lastName = "Roberts";
  var fullName = firstName + lastname;
  console.log(fullName); // Julia Roberts

  var yearBorn = 1975;
  var currentYear = 2016;
  Var age = currentYear - yearBorn;
  console.log(age); // 41
